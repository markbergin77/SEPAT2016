To use Gradle.....
Go to base directory of SEPAT2016,
run:
gradlew build (builds and doesn't run)
gradlew run (builds and run's)
gradlew clean (cleans build)

I believe with the wrapper class I put in you DON'T need to install Gradle.

However if this doesn't work I'm using gradle v2.13, install that.
Then run with the same commands as I listed but leave out the w (eg. gradle build)

If there is anything you want me to add to the build file send me a slack message,
I've read most of the starters doco so can get what we need done.
