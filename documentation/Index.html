<p> This is the documentation for the COSC2299/2428 Software Engineering: Process and Tools Assignment part 1 for RMIT University.
These pages are meant to make things a little easier when using (and marking) our final product the weather app, the idea for this app is for it to be used for primarily interest or scientific research
for the weather over recent and the extended number of days.  
Click on any of the links above to travel to their directed pages.
</p>

<p> The <b> Installation and Compilation </b> area will give you information regarding the installation (and possibly compilation) of our product.
I urge you to read these details before trying to run the program as it contains neccersary details that are needed before running of the weather application.
</p>

<p> The <b> Navigation and use </b> area will give provide a tutorial on how to use the program after installation and compilation, I reccomend that you read this before you attempt to use the app to get the most
truest weather experience from our intentions.

<p> I hope that you enjoy the program and hopefully be able to document some useful weather details within the last 12 months. </p>
