<p> This is the documentation for the COSC2299/2428 Software Engineering: Process and Tools Assignment part 1 for RMIT University.
These pages are meant to make things a little easier when using (and marking) our final weather app product, the idea for this app is for it to be used for primarily personal interest or personal research about the weather over a period of recent to an extended number of days. Hence this documentation is designed to be “user” documentation rather than “technical”, so the language is directed to the audience and can be classified as informal in certain areas.  
Click on any of the links above to travel to specific topics in the use and installation of our application..
</p>

<p> The <b> Installation and Compilation </b> area will give you information regarding the installation (and possibly compilation) of our product.
I urge you to read these details before trying to run the program as it contains necessary details that are needed before any weather application usage.
</p>

<p> The <b> Navigation and use </b> area will provide a tutorial on how to use the program after installation and compilation, I recommend that you read this before you attempt to use the app in order to get the most truest weather experience based on our design intentions.

<p> I hope that you enjoy the program and hopefully be able to document some useful weather details within the last 12 months. </p>
