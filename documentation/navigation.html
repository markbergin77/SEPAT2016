<p>After installation go ahead and open up the program.
This is the home screen and heart of the program:
PICTURE OF HOME SCREEN.

Through here, you can access the information of any weather station throughout Australia and the Antarctic region.
At the top you will see a search bar, this is useful for finding a specific station.
Just type in your desired location and the system should narrow the list down for you.
INSERT PICTURE OF SEARCHING FOR LOCATION AND LIST CHANGE.

Now once you have located the perfect location, click the button to display the list of options available for you.

</p>

<p>You can already see here a list of average locations over the past 72 hour period,
this is essentially what the recent average temperature throughout different time periods of the day.
Further information can be explored when clicking on one of the desired buttons that mentions a graph.
The first of which is xxxxx, lets take a look at that now.

</p>
<p>

</p>

That was xxxx graph, let's take a look at the other graph.
INSERT PICTURE OF GRAPH
</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>Close those two graphs and let's head back to the home screen...
</p>

<p>
From here you've gone through almost all of what the program has to offer.
The last feature to be explained is the favourites system.
In order to make searching for your desired stations easier in the future, you can click this button after finding a location.
INSERT BUTTON OF FAVOURITES THING
</p>

<p>
This will add the station in your favourites tab:
INSERT FAVOURITES TAB PHOTO. 
</p>

<p>
After closing and opening up the program, you're favourites will be exactly where you let them. So don't worry about losing your list!
